# File-Organizer
The Python script file_organizer.py is a simple tool for organizing files in a directory based on their last modified date. The script loops through all the files in the directory and moves files that were last modified more than a year ago to a subdirectory named after the year of their last modification. This can help keep your files organized and make it easier to find files that you may not have accessed recently.

### Prerequisites
The script requires Python 3.x to be installed on your system.

### How to Use
- Copy the file_organizer.py script to the directory that you want to organize.
- Open a command prompt or terminal window and navigate to the directory where the script is located.
- Run the script by typing python file_organizer.py and pressing Enter.
- The script will automatically create subdirectories for each year that contains files that were last modified more than a year ago, and move the files to their corresponding subdirectories.
